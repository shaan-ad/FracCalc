# FracCalc
Fraction Calculator

Two classes one called Fraction and the other called FracCalc are implemented. The Fraction class is an object that holds information about a fraction (numerator and denominator). It has several constructors and both private and public methods implementing the behavior of a fraction. The FracCalc class is a class that allows the user to enter in fractions and operations, calculating and displaying the result. It runs until the user tells it to quit. You wonâ€™t have to second guess your fraction arithmetic ever again!
